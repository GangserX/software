# Sample Music Files

This directory contains sample music files for the Spotify clone application.

## Note
These are placeholder references. In a real application, you would:

1. **Add actual music files** (MP3, WAV, FLAC, etc.)
2. **Implement file system scanning** to detect music files
3. **Extract metadata** using libraries like node-id3 or music-metadata
4. **Handle different audio formats** appropriately

## Sample Files Structure
```
sample-music/
├── sample1.mp3    (Placeholder)
├── sample2.mp3    (Placeholder)  
├── sample3.mp3    (Placeholder)
└── README.md      (This file)
```

## Adding Real Music
To add real music files:
1. Place your MP3/audio files in this directory
2. Update the sample tracks in App.js to reference real files
3. Implement proper metadata extraction
4. Add error handling for missing files
